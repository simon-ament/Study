# History
## Philosophy
- Model the objects of the world (domain objects and relationships)
- **noun-oriented** (as opposed to verb-oriented)
- **messaging**
- encapsulation / containment of data
	- better control access
	- better control consistency
- inheritance: complex objects as extension of simple ones

## Birth of objects
- Objects as **models of real-world entities**
- Objects as **cells** (independent, interacting)
- Objects **scale well**
	- **Complexity** through distributed responsibility
	- **Robustness** through independence
	- **Growth** by having same mechanisms everywhere
	- **Reuse** by providing services

## Object Oriented Programming
- Messages
- Objects
	- contain code and data
	- can be called through messaging
	- internals are inaccessible from the outside
- Classes
	- blueprint of objects (object creation)
	- specializations of other classes
	- organization of concepts and code

# Squeak / Smalltalk
- The Lisp of object-oriented languages
	- very little syntax, highly reflective
- Dynamic Typing
	- unrestricted polymorphism, very late binding
- Virtual Machine
	- write one, run everywhere
	- Bytecode compiler
	- Important files: Virtual Machine, Image file, Sources file, Changes file
