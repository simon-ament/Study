# History
## Philosophy
- Model the objects of the world (domain objects and relationships)
- **noun-oriented** (as opposed to verb-oriented)
- **messaging**
- encapsulation / containment of data
	- better control access
	- better control consistency
- inheritance: complex objects as extension of simple ones

## Birth of objects
- Objects as **models of real-world entities**
- Objects as **cells** (independent, interacting)
- Objects **scale well**
	- **Complexity** through distributed responsibility
	- **Robustness** through independence
	- **Growth** by having same mechanisms everywhere
	- **Reuse** by providing services
