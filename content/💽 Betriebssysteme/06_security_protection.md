# Security
- A system is **secure** if resources used and accessed as intended under all circumstances
	- unachievable
	- **safety:** A system does not cause harm to it's environment
- **Security Violation Categories**
	- Breach of confidentiality (unauthorized data read)
	- Breach of integrity (unauthorized data modification)
	- Breach of availability (unauthorized data destruction ==???==)
	- Theft of service (unauthorized use of resources)
	- Denial of service (DOS)
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job
- **Four Layers:**
	1. Application
	2. Operating System
	3. Network
	4. Physical
## Program Threats
**Malware:** Software designed to exploit, disable, or damage computer
- **Trojan Horse**
	- **Spyware**
	- **Ransomware**
	- **Trap Door**
- **Code Injection:** System code is not malicious, but has bugs allowing executable code to be added or modified
	- *Possible Protection for buffer overflows:* disable stack or page execution
- **Virus:** Embedded in legitimate program | self-replicating, designed to infect other computers
	- **Virus Dropper:** Inserts virus onto the system
- **Worms:** similar to virus, distribution over networks

## Attack Methods
- **Port scanning:** Automated attempt to connect to a range of ports on one or a range of IP addresses
	- detection of answering service protocol
	- detection of OS and version running on system
	- frequently launched from **zombie systems** (decrease trace-ability)
- **Denial of Service:** Overload the targeted computer preventing it from doing any useful work
	- e.g. **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDos):** come from multiple sites at once
	- might also happen accidentally or due to high legitimate traffic

# Cryptography
- broadest security tool available
- Source and destination of messages on network cannot be trusted without cryptography
- based on secrets (**keys**)

## Encryption
- **Symmetric:** Same key used to encrypt and decrypt
	- plaintext $\Rightarrow$ encryption $\Rightarrow$ **cyphertext**
	- a secure medium is needed to exchange key, only then communication via insecure channels is possible (**out of band**)
	- based on transformations (fast)
- **Asymmetric:** Each user has to keys: **public** (used for encryption) and **private** (known to only individual user, used for decryption)
	- based on mathematical functions (slow)
	- can be stored on **key ring** (==???==)
	- man-in-the-middle-attack still possible

## Authentication
- Constraining set of potential senders of a message
	- can prove message unmodified
	- can be based on **hash functions**
	- can be based on **digital signature** (inversion of asymmetric encryption, public and private key)
	- **Digital Certificates:** proof who or what owns a public key
- **Passwords**
	- only encrypted passwords stored (hash function with salt)
	- one-time password can be generated by the computer
	- can be replaced with biometrics
	- can be extended to multi-factor authentication

## Example: TLS
- used in transport layer
- also called SLL (Secure Socket Layer)
- Used between web servers and browsers for secure communication (socket creation)

# Defenses
- **signature based:** spot known bad patterns
- **anomaly detection:** spot difference from normal behavior
	- can also detect **zero-day** attakcs
- **sandboxing:** execute untrusted programs in a VM
- avoid human error (educate users)
- keep software up to date and trusted

## Firewall
- placed between trusted and untrusted hosts
- can be tunneled (disallowed protocal via allowed protocol) or spoofed (avoid IP address based rules)

# Windows
- Permission can be applied to all shareable resources (NTFS but not FAT file system)
- Encrypted File System protects data while OS is offline
- **Local Security Authority (LSA)** runs as local user-mode process
	- implements policies (e.g. password, logon, authentication, logs)
	- another LSA on domain controller (network)
	- Security Reference Monitor running in Kernel
	- **Security Accounts Manager (SAM):** manages database of users and passwords
	- **Active Directory:** contains a database storing information about domain objects
	- **Net Logon:** responds to network logon request, handled as local logon via LSASS authentication service
	- **Winlogon:** manages user sessions
